Build your own page by editing the README.md (home page) and creating new .md files (other pages) in your forked repository, formatting is done with standard GitHub Markdown syntax, we provide an example file example.md in the repository.
Important: Please include --- layout: default â€” (the first three lines in example.md) at the beginning of your every newly created .md file.
Add your new .md files to the site by editing the _config.yml file in your forked repository. Under navigation: add a new pair of - title: and url:, and fill their value with your page name and .md file name. Remember to remove the - title: and url: pair for the example page.
